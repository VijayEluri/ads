Here follows a set of implementations of various algorithms and data structures
which I developed for learning purposes through the years. The list here is not
intended to be either complete or exaustive but I'll try to improve that as
soon as I have some time to spend.

What you'll find:
.
|-- optimization/ (combinatorial optimization algorithms)
|   `-- Simulated Annealing
|-- sorting/ (sorting algorithms)
|   `-- insertion sort
|   `-- selection sort
`-- trees/ (various trees implementations)
    `-- heap
    `-- trie

TODO:
- lay out a better organization
- have running examples of every algorithm/data structure
