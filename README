This repository contains a set of self-contained implementations of several
common algorithms and data structures in different programming languages.
The implementation of these algorithms/data structures is not to be intended
as a reference and most of these implementations are far from being generic
and written well enough to consider their inclusion in any production system.

Additionally, there are also some interview questions and solutions for each
programming language. The description of the interview question is in the
file itself.
