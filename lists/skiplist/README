Skip lists are a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees.
The search time is O(logn) but has lower constants than balanced
trees and is easier to implement.
The version here proposed is a simplicistic version of skip lists,
indeed keys are integers from 0 to MAX_INT and values are integers
as well.
On my desktop computer, inserting 40000000 items takes only 25s
(I have 1.5Gb of RAM so it swaps just a little, if you can keep
everything in memory I'd expect much lower values) while
searching for a random value takes less than 0.0001s.
